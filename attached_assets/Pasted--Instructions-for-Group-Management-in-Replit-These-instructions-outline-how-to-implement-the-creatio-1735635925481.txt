Instructions for Group Management in Replit
These instructions outline how to implement the creation, editing, deleting, and naming of groups for a Matter-enabled controller in Replit. This functionality will be part of the Matter Maestro project, which allows users to manage groups of devices through a user-friendly UI.

Step-by-Step Guide
1. Group Creation
Objective: Allow users to create a new group by assigning a unique Group ID, providing a name, and selecting devices.
UI Components:
Form Elements:
Input field for Group Name.
Input field for Group ID (auto-generated or manually entered).
Multi-select dropdown for choosing devices (list of available devices from the Matter fabric).
Button to Submit the group details.
Backend Logic:
Validate the Group ID for uniqueness within the fabric.
Assign a multicast IP address to the group.
Add the group to the Matter server and persist its details (e.g., in a JSON file or database).
2. Group Editing
Objective: Allow users to edit group details, including renaming the group, modifying the Group ID, or changing the devices in the group.
UI Components:
List of Existing Groups:
Display each group’s Group Name, Group ID, and list of devices.
Include an Edit Button for each group.
Edit Form:
Prefill the group’s current details in editable fields.
Allow changes to:
Group Name.
Group ID (ensure it remains unique).
Devices (add or remove devices).
Button to Save Changes.
Backend Logic:
On save, validate the new details (e.g., unique Group ID).
Update the group configuration on the Matter server.
Persist the updated group details.
3. Group Deletion
Objective: Allow users to delete a group, removing it from the Matter server and any associated devices.
UI Components:
List of Existing Groups:
Include a Delete Button for each group.
Prompt for confirmation before deletion (e.g., "Are you sure you want to delete this group?").
Backend Logic:
On confirmation, remove the group from the Matter server.
Clear the multicast IP address and group membership for devices in the group.
Delete the group details from persistent storage.
4. Naming Groups
Objective: Allow users to assign meaningful names to groups for easy identification and management.
UI Components:
Input field for Group Name during group creation or editing.
Display Group Name prominently in the group list.
Backend Logic:
Store the Group Name along with the Group ID and other details.
Ensure the Group Name can be updated during editing.
Use the Group Name in the UI to enhance readability (e.g., "Living Room Lights" instead of "Group 101").
